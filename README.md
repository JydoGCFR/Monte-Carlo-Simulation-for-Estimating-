# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-for-Estimating-
The objective of this project is to estimate the value of π using the Monte Carlo simulation technique. This method utilizes random numbers to simulate the process of throwing darts at a square board containing an inscribed quarter-circle to approximate the value of π.
